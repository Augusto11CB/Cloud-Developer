## Nice Terms/Info to Know
Loosely coupled systems are recommended over monolithic systems, as they reduce technical debt.

### Technical Debt
The cost (in time and resources) of additional code rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer to implement.

### Microservices
Microservices are individual specialized systems (software deployed on specialized infrastructure) designed to accomplish a specific task. Specific tasks may include things like authentication, image processing, or data management.
